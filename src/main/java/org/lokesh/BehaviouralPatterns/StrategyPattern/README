--->Strategy Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that lets you define a family of algorithms,
put each one in a separate class, and make them interchangeable at runtime.

--->“Choose the behavior at runtime without changing the object.”

--->When we need to select one option or behavior from multiple choices at runtime, we use the Strategy Pattern.”

----------------------------------Without Strategy Pattern:

Too many if-else or switch statements

One class doing too many things

Hard to add new behavior

Violates Open–Closed Principle

-----------------------------------With Strategy Pattern:

Each behavior is isolated

Easy to add new behavior

Cleaner and flexible design

-----Real Applications of strategy pattern
