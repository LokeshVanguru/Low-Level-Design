Observer Pattern:

Definition:

Observer Pattern defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state,
all its dependents are notified automatically without tight coupling.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Problem: There is a need to notify multiple objects about a change in state without
tightly coupling them.
Solution: The Observer Pattern defines a one-to-many dependency. When one
object (the Subject) changes its state, all its dependents (the Observers) are notified
and updated automatically. This pattern is widely used for implementing distributed
event-handling systems, also known as the publish-subscribe pattern.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Motivation:

Suppose we have a weather station that records temperature and multiple devices
(e.g., display units) want to show the latest temperature. Without using the observer
pattern, the weather station would have to explicitly inform each device about the
temperature change, which results in tight coupling between the station and devices.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Structure:

Subject: Maintains a list of observers and notifies them of changes.
Observers: Receive updates from the subject.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Benefits:

---->Loose Coupling: The subject (e.g., WeatherStation) doesn’t need to know
     about the specific observers. It just notifies them.
---->Scalability: New observers (e.g., new display devices) can easily be added
      without changing the subject.
---->Flexibility: Observers can be dynamically added or removed at runtime.


----------------------------------------------------------------------

Applications or USE cases:

---->Event Listeners: GUI frameworks often use the Observer Pattern to
     implement event listeners for handling button clicks, input changes, etc.
---->Stock Price Monitoring: When a stock price changes, multiple subscribers
     ( like investors or systems) can be notified of the change.
---->News Publishing Systems: News articles are published (subject), and
      subscribers (users) are notified whenever a new article is available.
---->Social Media Notifications: Users can subscribe to updates from specific
      accounts, and when an account posts (subject), all followers (observers) are notified.
---->Logging Systems: Different logging handlers can observe events and log
      them as needed, such as to the console, file, or remote server
