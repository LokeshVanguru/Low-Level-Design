Single Responsibility Principle
Definition:A class should have one reason to change ,means it should only have one responsibility

bad come example:
    In the Invoice class, we are performing three different responsibilities:

    Generating the invoice

    Saving the invoice to the database

    Sending notifications

    If we want to change any functionality (for example, database logic or notification logic),
    we must modify the Invoice class itself.

GoodCode Example:
    In the good design, we create separate classes for each responsibility:

    Invoice → Invoice generation

    InvoiceRepository → Database operations

    NotificationService → Sending notifications

    Now, if we need to change any one functionality,
    we can modify the corresponding class without affecting the others.
